Description: `redcaptargets` provides integration between REDCap databases 
  and the `targets` pipeline toolkit, streamlining reproducible data workflows 
  in clinical research. It uses the `redcapAPI` package as a backend to 
  connect to REDCap and automatically creates dynamic targets for metadata and 
  instrument-level data. Built-in support for REDCap logging allows data 
  to be re-pulled only when meaningful changes are detected, avoiding 
  unnecessary computation. Modular factory functions reduce boilerplate and 
  adapt easily to evolving study designs.
